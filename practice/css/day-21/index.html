    <span>Shankar Pd Sharma</span>
    <span>It’s a matter of pleasure and pride for me to extend a warm welcome to all our new students. As I greet you to our prestigious institution, I wish to assure you that the environment we offer here is like a home away from home. We have a team of experienced, qualified and energetic faculties and staff members to guide you. We have a strong infrastructure, with well equipped computers, classrooms and an auditorium. Our staff are  committed faculty, who are adept at using advanced teaching aids. It is our aim to help all students realize the dreams they envision. For that, we provide  students with sufficient opportunities to discover and understand themselves. We also wish to help them face and overcome challenges that accost them and to make student life fulfilling and complete. We provide a holistic education. Given a strong and sound infrastructure, we would like our students to work in an environment, where they are stretched and challenged. We have high expectations of them to achieve demandin</span>
